    "### Abstract:\n",
    "Current stock prices continue to fluctuate, and even more so in times of recession. In our last large recession in 2009, the housing market was the prime aggravator of the stock market plummet; causing both industries to crash. We sought out to see if this correlation could be localized to the housing market of a company’s headquarters, and if we could use previous market fluctuation to help us predict or understand future market fluctuations."

This meant that as stock prices rose, housing prices also increased and vice versa in the same months. To determine if this correlation was more evident in specific industry types, the 14 companies were grouped by type (retail, financial, other, tech). Although all the industries showed positive correlations, the tech industry was the most correlated suggesting that the tech companies may have the most influence in housing prices in their headquarter city."
